Times for archery sessions are fixed, and you will be required to arrive 10 minutes before your allocated start time. If one or more members of the group are late, it may not be possible to incorporate them into the group after instruction has started. No one suspected of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs will be allowed to shoot. Straight to the Point Archery is not liable for any losses or damage to clothing, footwear, or personal effects.
